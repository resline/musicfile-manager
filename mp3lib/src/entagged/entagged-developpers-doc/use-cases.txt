We can imagine two kind of Entagged (ET from now on) users:

	-The novice user, or regular user:
		He want a software to tag mostly automatically and transparently his musical files, without worrying about
		what is happening, or what kind of tag he is using. He want this to "just work". The library could be used
		to prepare a report of the audio files he is taking on holiday, in a simple html, or exell spreadsheet.
		The freedb function should be intuitive, and straitforward. Renaming the files from the tag should be easy,
		and should work with a lot of files at once.
	
	-The power user, or the "one know what happens behind"
		He wants all what a novice would want, but he should be given access to all the advanced features,
		such as SQL query in the database, access to the specific tags for each tag format, rename using regex, etc.
		A specific part of the GUI should be dedicated to this usage.
		
Here come the true use cases.
